    <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a

            <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                into a
                horrible vermin.</p>

            <p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
                slightly
                domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>

    <h3>Responsive Breakpoints</h3>
    <p>Heading size, font size, and line height can have different sizes based on minimum screen width.
        Address the different minimum screen sizes with responsive breakpoints, wich are indicated by CSS class
        prefix values
        of:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="float-left"><code>.sm-</code></dt>
        <dd>The size is applied only if the screen is at least of small width.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt class="float-left"><code>.rg-</code></dt>
        <dd>The size is applied only if the screen is at least of regular size.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>

    <p>E.g. <code>.lg-fs-1</code>, <code>.md-h1</code>, or <code>.rg-lh-3</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>.x</code> and <code>.xl</code> layout grids can have a different horizontal structure based on

        <code>.sm-wide</code> for at least minimum screen width and <code>.rg-breakout</code> for at least regular
        screen width.
        Address the different minimum screen sizes with column prefix values of</p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="float-left"><code>.sm-</code></dt>
        <dd>The grid structure is applied only if the screen is at least of small width</dd>

        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
            horrible vermin.</p>

        <p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
            domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
            ready to
            slide off any moment.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
            looked.
            <span class="quote">What's happened to me?</span> he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>

        <p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
            walls.
        </p>

        <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above
            it
            there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
            gilded
            frame.</p>

        <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that
            covered
            the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull
            weather.</p>

        <p>Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. <span class="quote">How

            do
            because he
            was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position.</p>

        <p>However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried
            it a
            hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped
            when
            he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.</p>

    <h3>Responsive Breakpoints</h3>
    <p class="mrt">The column count can vary based on available screen width.
        Address the different minimum screen sizes with responsive breakpoints, wich are indicated by CSS class
        prefix values values of:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="float-left"><code>.sm-</code></dt>

    <h2 id="column-grid">12 Column Grid</h2>

    <p>Any space can be divided horizontally into 12ths. E.g. nesting the column grid into the layout grid is a
        typical case.</p>
    <p>The sum of the cols per row has to add up to 12. Not specifiying a column size will result in taking
        the entire grid width into one column.</p>
